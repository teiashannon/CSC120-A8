Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The class that I created represents a user-driven video game in which the user is presented with various actions and is able to not only choose how many actions they would like to complete, but also specify which action and for some actions, enter parameters. This creates an interactive experience for the user and represents a useful implementation of the interface idea. I implemented an additional method to print the user's inventory, as I thought it would be a good idea to have an inventory for the items they grabbed, dropped, used, and examined. The hardest part of this assignment was coming up with a creative idea to implement the many provided methods. I struggled for a while with what to use them for and worried that I was not using them meaningfully enough.
